This is the README file for Paper ``Learning Strategy-Aware Linear Classifiers''. We refer the reader also to our Supplementary Material Section D, where we discuss both the polytope library and the regression oracles.

Folder cont_code/ contains the implementation for the continuous variant, and folder discr_code/ contains the implementation for the discretized variant.

It is run using python 2.7. and it has the following required packages: 
*** cont_code/ ***
-- numpy
-- cvxpy 
-- polytope
-- multiprocessing 
-- sklearn
-- logging
-- os
*** extra packages required for discr_code/ ***
-- networkx
-- sys



File that controls the distribution of points: params.py.

File that controls the power of the agent (i.e., \delta): runner-dp.py

In order to run the code: python runner-dp.py.

Please see individual .py files for explanations regarding the functionality of each file.
